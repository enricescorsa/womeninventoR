# womeninventoR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of the womeninventoR package is to share a patent data set of women inventors for its analysis within R. 

![](hexsticker_womeninventor.png)

Data has been obtained from a a series of data tables that are available for bulk download from USPTO's Patentsview page here: https://patentsview.org/download/data-download-tables


See the initial bulk downloading process followed by Paul Oldham @poldham here: https://github.com/poldham/patentsview2021/blob/master/patentsview_bulk.Rmd

The building of the patent dataset (´womeninventorpatents´) from the downloaded files is described in the ´DATASET.R´ file included in the ´data-raw´ folder.

The data set contains nearly 400.000 granted patents by women inventors in the US within 2016 and 2020.
It contains main patent data fields as columns (textual fields such as Title and Abstract and other useful metadata such as Patent Classification Codes, names of assignee organisations and publication dates)


## Installation

You can install it from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("enricescorsa/womeninventoRs")

```
## Example

The womeninventoR package allows you to load the ´womeninventorpatents´  data set and analyse it.

```{r example}
library(womeninventoR)

womeninventorpatents
```


First, let's see the evolution in the number of granted patents through time.

We can plot a line chart showing the number of patents by year.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
#first we count the number of patents by year
patents_year <-  womeninventorpatents %>%
  group_by (patentsyear) %>%
  summarise (count=n ())

patents_year <-  na.omit(patents_year) # we use na.omit to exclude missing values


#then we can plot the line chart evolution
ggplot(data = patents_year, aes(x = patentsyear, y = count, group = 1)) +
    geom_line(aes(color = '#660F56')) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = "Nº Patents",
       x = "Year",
       title = "Evolution of patents by women",
       subtitle = "Nº of granted patents by year") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```
